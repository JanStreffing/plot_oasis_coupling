Memory Management
===============

Working with large climate model datasets can be memory-intensive. This guide provides strategies to optimize memory usage when working with the flux visualization tool.

Resolution Considerations
-----------------------

The remapping resolution has the most significant impact on memory usage:

+---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Resolution    | Memory Impact           | Recommendation                |
+===============+=========================+===============================+
| 0.5° (default)| Moderate               | Good balance for most datasets|
+---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 0.25°         | High (4x more than 0.5°)| Only use with small datasets |
+---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------+

For datasets covering the entire globe, quarter-degree (0.25°) remapping requires significantly more memory than half-degree (0.5°) remapping. The memory usage scales approximately with the square of the resolution ratio.

Sequential vs. Parallel Processing
--------------------------------

Processing mode affects both performance and memory usage:

+---------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Mode          | Performance      | Memory Usage        |
+===============+==================+=====================+
| Parallel      | Faster           | Higher              |
+---------------+------------------+---------------------+
| Sequential    | Slower           | Lower               |
+---------------+------------------+---------------------+

When processing large datasets:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Lower memory usage but slower processing
    python plot_fluxes.py --sequential

Memory Diagnostics
----------------

To monitor memory usage during execution:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Enable verbose output with memory diagnostics
    python plot_fluxes.py --verbose

This will print memory usage statistics at key points during processing.

Memory-Saving Strategies
======================

1. **Process Fewer Files**: During testing, limit the number of files processed:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
       python plot_fluxes.py --max-files 5

2. **Skip Remapping**: If you only need native grid visualizations:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
       python plot_fluxes.py --no-remap

3. **Process One Folder at a Time**: Instead of processing all folders at once:

   .. code-block:: bash
   
       # Process first experiment folder
       python plot_fluxes.py --folder flux_33
       
       # Then process second experiment folder
       python plot_fluxes.py --folder flux_34

4. **Adjust Dask Settings**: For advanced users, you can adjust Dask's chunk size in the code:

   .. code-block:: python
   
       # Smaller chunks use less memory but with more processing overhead
       dask.config.set({"array.chunk-size": "64MiB"})  # Default is 128MiB

Hardware Recommendations
======================

For large datasets (global climate models at high resolution):

- Minimum 16GB RAM for half-degree remapping
- 32GB+ RAM recommended for quarter-degree remapping
- SSD storage for faster I/O operations

External Processing Options
========================

For extremely large datasets that exceed local memory resources:

1. **Use High-Performance Computing Facilities**: With more memory and processing power
2. **Process in Batches**: Divide dataset into smaller batches
3. **Cloud-Based Processing**: Consider using cloud computing resources

Profiling and Optimization
========================

To identify memory bottlenecks:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install memory profiler
    pip install memory_profiler

    # Run script with profiling
    python -m memory_profiler plot_fluxes.py

This will show memory usage for each line of code, helping identify which operations consume the most memory.
